## Welcome to LongMetal Robotics! Are you ready to play for real?  
  
### Who are we?  
Longmetal Robotics is a rookie FRC team from Longmeadow, Massachusetts. We are comprised of approximately 20 
students and 5 mentors. We are planning to compete in two tournaments in Conneticut.  
  
### What will this site be used for?  
We will use this site as documentation for our code and as a method of collaboration for our team members.  
  
  
Anyway, that's all for now, and **so long, and thanks for all the fish!**
