## Welcome to LongMetal Robotics! Are you ready to play for real?  
  
### Who are we?  
Longmetal Robotics is a rookie FRC team from Longmeadow, Massachusetts. We are comprised of approximately 20 
students and 5 mentors. We are planning to compete in two tournaments in Conneticut.  
  
### What will this site be used for?  
We will use this site as documentation for our code and as a method of collaboration for our team members.  

### What is the current status of the robot?  
We currently are in the process of trying to transition the electrical system from out prototype piece of wood
to a nicely laid out piece of metal. Before this meeting, the robot was able to drive. Soon, we will have the
electronics laid out and the robot working again.
  
Anyway, that's all for now, and **so long, and thanks for all the fish!**
