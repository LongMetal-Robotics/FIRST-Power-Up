## Welcome to LongMetal Robotics! Are you ready to play for real?  
  
### Who are we?  
Longmetal Robotics is a rookie FRC team from Longmeadow, Massachusetts. We are comprised of approximately 20 
students and 5 mentors. We are planning to compete in two tournaments in Conneticut.  
  
### What will this site be used for?  
We will use this site as documentation for our code and as a method of collaboration for our team members.  

### What is the current status of the robot?  
The robot is currently (until our next meeting, when we will be able to build and upload the code) able to spin 
in circles and using centripital force, throw the battery off of itself (whoops). After the next meeting, this 
document will be updated with the new status
  
Anyway, that's all for now, and **so long, and thanks for all the fish!**
