## Welcome to LongMetal Robotics! Are you ready to play for real?  
  
### Who are we?  
Longmetal Robotics is a rookie FRC team from Longmeadow, Massachusetts. We are comprised of approximately 20 
students and 5 mentors. We are planning to compete in two tournaments in Conneticut.  
  
### What will this site be used for?  
We will use this site as documentation for our code and as a method of collaboration for our team members.  

### What is the current status of the robot?  
Our robot is fully working and ready for competition. It can drive, pick up and drop cubes, and score points for 
us. We have a vertical arm driven by a lead screw with a pneumatic gripper, and a six-wheeled drive train.
  
Anyway, that's all for now, and **so long, and thanks for all the fish!**
